Changelog
=========

Agent Spec |release|
--------------------

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Improved HTTPS handling for LangGraph MCP remote transports**

  Non-mTLS LangGraph MCP SSE and Streamable HTTP transports now use the standard
  system trust store for server certificate checks, while mTLS transports continue
  to use explicit client certificate configuration.

* **More reliable tool payload tracing in LangGraph adapter**

  The LangGraph adapter now normalizes tool callback inputs before emitting tracing events,
  preserving structured tool execution payloads more reliably in traced agents and flows.

* **Improved OpenAI Agents code generation**

  The OpenAI Agents adapter now emits specification-derived string values as
  Python literals in generated workflow code and validates supported model
  settings before emission.

* **New xAI model provider for OciGenAiConfig**

  Introduced a new provider `XAI` for ``OciGenAiConfig`` LLMs.

* **Convenience serialization APIs on Components**

  Components now expose direct serialization and deserialization helpers:
  ``to_yaml()``, ``to_json()``, ``to_dict()``, ``from_yaml()``,
  ``from_json()``, and ``from_dict()``.
  This provides a shorter API (e.g., ``agent.to_json()``) while preserving
  compatibility with disaggregated configurations.

  We thank @pullely-samuel for the contribution!

* **Disaggregated configurations in LangGraph adapter**

  The LangGraph adapter now supports loading disaggregated components during deserialization.
  Use `AgentSpecLoader.load_yaml/json(..., import_only_referenced_components=True)` to import
  referenced components (e.g., LLM configs, tools), optionally modify them, and then pass them back
  via `components_registry` when loading the main configuration. This enables keeping sensitive
  fields (like API keys) out of the main spec while still resolving them at load time.

* **Added AGENTS.md file:**

  Added AGENTS.md file, a dedicated, open-format guide to help AI coding agents work effectively with the project
  by providing essential context, build/test commands, code style guidelines, and other key instructions.

  We thank @kanak02rawat for the contribution!

* **Tracing in LangGraph adapter flows**

  The LangGraph adapter now supports emitting Agent Spec tracing spans and events for Flows.
  It also adds tracing support for async APIs of LangGraph (e.g. `ainvoke`, `astream`).
  Note that this PR might break existing downstream LangGraph tracing span processors if they run in ab async environment;
  span processors will need to implement the async APIs (e.g. async def on_event_async) to properly use the async tracing mode.

* **Async server tools in LangGraph adapter**

  The LangGraph adapter now converts async server-tool callables to ``StructuredTool(coroutine=...)``
  instead of ``func=...``, so async tools execute correctly when loaded from Agent Spec.

* **OCI GenAI model support in LangGraph adapter**

  The LangGraph adapter now supports loading/exporting OCI GenAI models.
  Users can now use models such ss Grok and Meta models available on the OCI GenAI service.
  Install with `pip install pyagentspec[langgraph-full]` to access this feature.

* **Improved template placeholder rendering in adapters**

  Template placeholders in adapter utilities are now rendered by matching placeholders
  directly in the source template instead of recursively splitting the template text.
  This keeps unresolved placeholders unchanged and makes the rendering logic easier to follow.

* **Component loading defaults**

  Agent Spec loaders now expose ``allowed_components`` and ``blocked_components`` options,
  allowing users to control which Agent Spec component types can be loaded from configurations.
  Component type names that resolve to known Component classes use hierarchy matching,
  like class entries; unresolved type names match only the exact serialized component type.

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **URL allow lists for RemoteTool and ApiNode**

  Added an optional ``url_allow_list`` field to ``RemoteTool`` and ``ApiNode`` to declare
  the allowed rendered URL targets when those components use templated URLs.

* **Retry policy for components doing remote calls:**

  Added ``retry_policy`` support to components doing remote calls to enable
  configuration of retries, backoff, and request timeouts across remote integrations.

  For more information read the guide on :ref:`using LLM providers <howto-llmwithretrypolicy>`.

* **Generic LlmConfig with provider-agnostic fields**

  ``LlmConfig`` is now a concrete class that can be used directly without requiring a dedicated
  subclass for each LLM provider. New fields ``model_id``, ``provider``, ``api_provider``,
  ``api_type``, ``url``, and ``api_key`` allow describing any LLM connection generically. Existing subclasses (``OpenAiConfig``,
  ``OciGenAiConfig``, etc.) continue to work unchanged. All framework adapters support bare ``LlmConfig``
  instances through string-based dispatch on ``api_provider``.

  We thank @spichen for the contribution!

* **Certificate configuration for OpenAI-compatible LLMs**

  ``OpenAiCompatibleConfig`` now supports optional ``key_file``, ``cert_file``, and ``ca_file``
  fields for HTTPS and mTLS connections to private endpoints.

  For more information read the how-to guide on using :ref:`LLM Providers <howto-openaicompatibleconfig>`.

* **New tool output streaming Event:**

  A new :ref:`ToolExecutionStreamingChunkReceived <toolexecutionstreamingchunkreceived>`
  is introduced to enable surfacing intermediate tool chunks when executing a long-running tool.

* **Swarm support in LangGraph adapter:**

  The LangGraph adapter now supports the conversion of the Swarm multi-agent pattern.

  To use this, install the optional extra ``pyagentspec[langgraph]``.

* **CatchExceptionNode:**

  Added a new node that executes a subflow and catches exceptions.
  When an exception is raised, it branches to ``caught_exception_branch``
  and exposes an additional output string information ``caught_exception_info``.

  For more information and security considerations, read the :ref:`API Reference <catchexceptionnode>`.

* **Introduced Open Agent Specification Evaluation:**

  Open Agent Specification Evaluation (Agent Spec Eval) is an extension of
  Agent Spec that standardizes how agentic systems are evaluated in a framework-agnostic way.

  The Agent Spec Eval Python SDK is now available as part of ``pyagentspec``.
  You can access its functionalities through the ``pyagentspec.evaluation`` subpackage.
  It requires the ``evaluation`` extra dependency to be installed.

  For more information read the :doc:`evaluation specification page <agentspec/evaluation>`.

* **Added WayFlow adapter to pyagentspec:**

  The WayFlow adapter is now available as part of ``pyagentspec``.
  You can access its functionality through the ``pyagentspec.adapters.wayflow`` subpackage.
  It requires the ``wayflow`` extra dependency to be installed.

  For more information read the :doc:`adapter page <adapters/wayflow/index>`.

* **Gemini LLM configuration support**

  Added ``GeminiConfig`` together with ``GeminiAIStudioAuthConfig`` and
  ``GeminiVertexAIAuthConfig`` to represent Gemini models in Agent Spec.

  For more information read the :doc:`API Reference <api/llmmodels>`.

* **Added Microsoft Agent Framework adapter to pyagentspec:**

  The Microsoft Agent Framework adapter is now available as part of ``pyagentspec``.
  You can access its functionality through the ``pyagentspec.adapters.agent_framework`` subpackage.
  It requires the ``agent-framework`` extra dependency to be installed.

* **Added OpenAI Agents SDK adapter to pyagentspec:**

  The OpenAI Agents adapter is now available as part of ``pyagentspec``.
  You can access its functionality through the ``pyagentspec.adapters.openaiagents`` subpackage.
  It requires the ``openai-agents`` extra dependency to be installed.

  For more information read the :doc:`adapter page <adapters/openai/index>`.

* **Added Flow Builder to simplify programmatic creation of Agent Spec Flows.**

  The Flow Builder is a new chainable API to create and serialize Agent Spec Flows more easily.

  For more information, see the :doc:`API Reference <api/flows>` and the :ref:`Reference Sheet <flowbuilder_ref_sheet>`.

* **Datastores**

  Added support for datastores in Agent Spec through :ref:`OracleDatabaseDatastore <oracledatabasedatastore>` and :ref:`PostgresDatabaseDatastore <postgresdatabasedatastore>`.
  Datastores enable persistent storage and caching capabilities for agent workflows. :ref:`InMemoryCollectionDatastore <inmemorycollectiondatastore>` provides a drop-in replacement for development and prototyping.

* **Context Summarization Transforms**

  Introduced transforms in Agent Spec that allow applying transformations on conversations before being passed to the underlying LLM.
  We provide :ref:`MessageSummarizationTransform <messagesummarizationtransform>` and :ref:`ConversationSummarizationTransform <conversationsummarizationtransform>` for handling long contexts through summarization.

* **ToolBox with User Confirmation**

  ToolBoxes now have a new flag named `requires_confirmation`, which can be set to require user/operator approval before running any of the tools in the toolbox.
  For more information read the :doc:`API Reference <api/tools>`.


Breaking Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **HTTPS certificate validation for LangGraph MCP remote transports**

  Non-mTLS LangGraph MCP SSE and Streamable HTTP transports now validate the
  server certificate using the system trust store by default. Connections that
  previously relied on self-signed, privately issued, expired, or hostname-mismatched
  certificates may now require updating the certificate setup, trusting the CA in
  the system store, or switching to the mTLS transport configuration.

* **Numeric model settings in OpenAI Agents code generation**

  ``temperature`` and ``top_p`` must now be numeric values, and ``max_tokens``
  must now be an integer, before the OpenAI Agents adapter emits them into
  generated workflow code.
  Configurations that supplied these values as strings should update them to
  numeric YAML/JSON values.

* **Empty titles in properties**

  Property titles in Agent Spec must not be empty. This is now enforced by validation in the pyagentspec SDK.

  Migration: If your YAML/JSON configurations have properties without titles, you’ll need to set a non-empty, descriptive title for those properties to pass validation. If you generate Agent Spec configurations via the SDK, your code may still work, but we recommend explicitly setting property titles to ensure forward compatibility.

* **MCP stdio transport is blocked by default in Agent Spec loaders**

  ``StdioTransport`` and its subclasses will no longer load by default through
  Agent Spec loaders. If a trusted configuration
  intentionally uses stdio transports, pass ``blocked_components=[]`` to the
  loader, or provide a custom ``blocked_components`` value that does not include
  the stdio transport component class.


Agent Spec 26.1.0
-----------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Added CrewAI adapter to pyagentspec:**

  The CrewAI adapter is now available as part of ``pyagentspec``.
  You can access its functionality through the ``pyagentspec.adapters.crewai`` subpackage.
  It requires the ``crewai`` extra dependency to be installed.

  For more information read the :doc:`API Reference <api/adapters>`.

* **MCP tools support in LangGraph adapter:**

  The LangGraph adapter now supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.

  To use this, install the optional extra ``pyagentspec[langgraph_mcp]`` and invoke the loaded graph/agent asynchronously via ``.ainvoke`` within an async context.

* **Added LangGraph adapter to pyagentspec:**

  The LangGraph adapter is now available as part of ``pyagentspec``.
  You can access its functionality through the ``pyagentspec.adapters.langgraph`` subpackage.
  It requires the ``langgraph`` extra dependency to be installed.

  For more information read the :doc:`adapter page <adapters/langgraph/index>`.

* **Added AutoGen adapter to pyagentspec:**

  The AutoGen adapter is now available as part of ``pyagentspec``.
  You can access its functionality through the ``pyagentspec.adapters.autogen`` subpackage.
  It requires the ``autogen`` extra dependency to be installed.

  For more information read the :doc:`adapter page <adapters/autogen/index>`.

* **Sensitive Fields Support:**

  New fields have been added to Agent Spec components that may carry sensitive data (e.g. the field `api_key` on :ref:`OpenAiCompatibleConfig <openaicompatibleconfig>`). To provide this functionality securely, we also introduced the annotation `SensitiveField` such that the sensitive fields are automatically excluded when exporting a Component to its JSON or yaml configuration.

  For more information read the :ref:`latest specification <agentspecsensitivefield_nightly>`.

* **OpenAI Responses API Support:**

  :ref:`OpenAiCompatibleConfig <openaicompatibleconfig>` and :ref:`OpenAIModel <openaiconfig>` now support the OpenAI Responses API, which can be configured
  using the ``api_type`` parameter, which accepts values from :ref:`OpenAIAPIType <openaiapitype>`.

  This enhancement allows recent OpenAI models to better leverage advanced reasoning capabilities, resulting in significant performance improvements in workflows.

  For more information read the :doc:`API Reference <api/llmmodels>`.

* **OCI Responses API Support:**

  :ref:`OciGenAiConfig <ocigenaiconfig>` now supports the OCI Responses API, which can be configured
  using the ``api_type`` parameter, which accepts values from :ref:`OciAPIType <ociapitype>`.

  This enhancement allows recent models to better leverage advanced reasoning capabilities, resulting in significant performance improvements in workflows.

  For more information read the :doc:`API Reference <api/llmmodels>`.

* **ParallelFlowNode and ParallelMapNode**

  Added support for parallelization in Agent Spec through :ref:`ParallelFlowNode <parallelflownode>`, which runs several
  flows in parallel, and :ref:`ParallelMapNode <parallelmapnode>`, which is a parallel version of the ``MapNode``.
  For more information, check out the corresponding :doc:`parallel flows how-to guide <howtoguides/howto_parallelflownode>`
  and :doc:`map-reduce how-to guide <howtoguides/howto_mapnode>`.

* **Tools with User Confirmation**

  Tools now have a new flag named `requires_confirmation`, which can be set to require user/operator approval before running the tool.
  For more information read the :doc:`API Reference <api/tools>`.

* **Swarm**

  Introduced Swarm in the Agent Spec Language Specification.
  For more information check out the corresponding :doc:`swarm how-to guide <howtoguides/howto_swarm>` or read the :ref:`API Reference <swarm>`.

* **AgentSpecialization**

  Introduced the concept of agent specialization in the Agent Spec Language Specification, which allows to tailor general-purpose :ref:`Agents <agent>` to specific use-cases.
  For more information read the :doc:`API Reference <api/agent_specialization>`.

* **ManagerWorkers**

  Introduced ManagerWorkers in the Agent Spec Language Specification.
  For more information check out the corresponding :doc:`managerworkers how-to guide <howtoguides/howto_managerworkers>` or read the :ref:`API Reference <managerworkers>`.

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Extended functionality for data parameter**

  Extended the data parameter in ``RemoteTool`` and ``ApiNode`` from only being a dictionary to any JSON serializable object (including nested objects).
  Also improved template rendering in the ``RemoteTool`` and ``ApiNode`` for PyAgentSpec adapters.

* **Python 3.14 support**

  Introduced support for Python version 3.14.

Breaking Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Sensitive Fields**

The below fields have been marked as carrying sensitive information and will be excluded from newly generated configurations automatically. See :ref:`latest specification <agentspecsensitivefield_nightly>` for more information on this. This change is implemented retroactively to impact older configurations too.

+----------------------------------+--------------------+
| SSEmTLSTransport                 | key_file           |
+----------------------------------+--------------------+
| SSEmTLSTransport                 | cert_file          |
+----------------------------------+--------------------+
| SSEmTLSTransport                 | ca_file            |
+----------------------------------+--------------------+
| StreamableHTTPmTLSTransport      | key_file           |
+----------------------------------+--------------------+
| StreamableHTTPmTLSTransport      | cert_file          |
+----------------------------------+--------------------+
| StreamableHTTPmTLSTransport      | ca_file            |
+----------------------------------+--------------------+

These field will now require to be passed explicitly when loading an exported configuration, as in the example below:

.. code-block:: python

    AgentSpecDeserializer().from_yaml(
        serialized_component,
        components_registry={
            "<component_id>.key_file": "client.key",
            "<component_id>.cert_file": "client.crt",
            "<component_id>.ca_file": "trustedCA.pem",
        },
    )
