Open Agent Specification Tracing (Agent Spec Tracing)
=====================================================

Overview
========

Open Agent Specification Tracing (short: Agent Spec Tracing) is an extension of
Agent Spec that standardizes how agent and flow executions emit traces.
It defines a unified, implementation-agnostic semantic for:

- Events: structured, point-in-time facts.
- Spans: time-bounded execution contexts that group events.
- Traces: trees of spans that represent an end-to-end execution.
- SpanProcessors: pluggable hooks to consume spans and events (e.g., export to UIs, tracing backends, or logs).

Agent Spec Tracing enables:

- Runtime adapters to emit consistent traces across different frameworks.
- Consumers (observability backends, UIs, developer tooling) to ingest one standardized format regardless of the producer.

Agent Spec Tracing aligns with widely used observability concepts (e.g.,
OpenTelemetry), while grounding definitions in Agent Spec components and
semantics. It specifies what spans and events to emit, when to emit them, and
which attributes to include, including which attributes are sensitive.

Scope and goals
---------------

- Provide a canonical list of span and event types for Agent Spec runtimes.
- Define lifecycle and attribute schema for each span/event.
- Identify sensitive fields and how they should be handled.
- Provide a minimal API surface for producers and consumers.
- Remain neutral to storage/transport (Telemetry, UIs, files, etc.).

Core Concepts
=============

Event
-----

An Event is an atomic episode that occurs at a specific time instant. It always belongs to exactly one Span.

Events have a definition similar to the Agent Spec Components, and they have the same descriptive fields:
``id``, ``name``, ``description``, ``type``, and ``metadata``.
Additionally, they require a ``timestamp`` that defines when the event occurred, and extensions of this class can
add more attributes based on the event they represent, aimed at preserving all the relevant information
related to the event being recorded.
Events can also have Sensitive fields, that are declared and must be handled per Agent Spec guidelines.

.. code-block:: python

   class Event:
       id: str  # Unique identifier for the event. Typically generated from component type plus a unique token.
       type: str  # Concrete type specifier for this event
       name: str  # Name of the event, if applicable
       description: str  # Description of the event, if applicable
       metadata: Dictionary[str, Any]  # Additional metadata that could be used for extra information
       timestamp: int  # nanoseconds since epoch

- timestamp: time of occurrence (ns). Producers should use monotonic clocks
  where possible and/or convert to wall-clock ns as configured by the runtime.

Agent Spec Tracing defines a set of Event types with specific attributes, that you can find in the following sections.


Span
----

A Span defines a time-bounded execution context. Each Span:

- starts at start_time (ns), ends at end_time (ns), end_time can be null if not closed.
- can contain zero or more Events.
- can be nested (child span has a parent span).


Also Spans have a definition similar to the Agent Spec Components, and they share the same descriptive fields:
``id``, ``name``, ``description``, ``type``, and ``metadata``.
Extensions of this Span can add more attributes based on the Span they represent.
Attributes on a Span typically reflect configuration that applies to the whole
duration of the Span (e.g., the Agent being executed, the LLM config, etc.).
Spans can also have Sensitive fields, that are declared and must be handled per Agent Spec guidelines.

Besides these attributes, Spans MUST also implement the following interface:

.. code-block:: python

   class Span:
       id: str  # Unique identifier for the span. Typically generated from component type plus a unique token.
       type: str  # Concrete type specifier for this span.
       name: str  # Name of the span, if applicable
       description: str  # Description of the span, if applicable
       metadata: Dictionary[str, Any]  # Additional metadata that could be used for extra information
       start_time: int
       end_time: Optional[int]
       events: List[Event]

       def start(self) -> None: ...

       def end(self) -> None: ...

       def add_event(self, event: Event) -> None: ...


- ``start``: called when the span starts.
- ``shutdown``: called when the span ends.
- ``add_event``: called when an event has to be added to this Span. It MUST append the event in the ``events`` attribute.

Lifecycle rules:

- Spans MUST have start_time when started, while end_time is set on end.
- Events added to a Span MUST have timestamps within [start_time, end_time], whenever end_time is known.
- Spans MAY contain child spans. Implementations SHOULD propagate correlation context so consumers can rebuild the tree.

Agent Spec Tracing defines a set of Span types with specific attributes, that you can find in the following sections.

SpanProcessor
-------------

A SpanProcessor receives callbacks when Spans start/end and when Events are added.
Processors are meant to consume the Agent Spec traces (spans, events) emitted by the runtime adapter
during the execution. They can be used to export traces to third parties consumers (e.g., to OpenTelemetry, files, UIs).

A SpanProcessor MUST implement the following interface.

.. code-block:: python

   class SpanProcessor(ABC):

       def on_start(self, span: Span) -> None: ...

       def on_end(self, span: "Span") -> None: ...

       def on_event(self, event: Event, span: Span) -> None: ...

       def startup(self) -> None: ...

       def shutdown(self) -> None: ...

- ``startup``: called when an Agent Spec Tracing session starts.
- ``shutdown``: called when an Agent Spec Tracing session ends.
- ``on_start``: called when a Span starts.
- ``on_end``: called when a Span ends.
- ``on_event``: called when an Event is added to a Span.

Trace
-----

A Trace groups all spans and events that belong to the same top-level assistant execution.
It is the root where all the SpanProcessors that must be active during the assistant execution are declared.

- Opening a Trace SHOULD call ``SpanProcessor.startup()`` on all configured processors.
- Closing a Trace SHOULD call ``SpanProcessor.shutdown()`` on all configured processors.

Deterministic identifiers and correlation
-----------------------------------------

Some events define correlation identifiers to allow consumers to link request/response and other events.

For example:

- request_id: unique identifier of a single LLM or Tool execution request within a Span.
- completion_id: identifier of a completion (LLM message or tool-call) which may receive streaming chunks.
- tool_execution_request_id: identifier of a tool execution for confirmation.

Runtimes SHOULD ensure uniqueness within a Span and consistency across all related events.


PyAgentSpecTracing (Python materialization)
===========================================

The ``pyagentspec.tracing`` subpackage of ``pyagentspec`` provides convenient Pydantic-based models and interfaces so that:

- Producers (adapters, runtimes) can emit spans/events according to Agent Spec Tracing standards.
- Consumers (exporters, UIs) can receive and consume them via SpanProcessors.

Emitting traces (producer example)
----------------------------------

Here's an example of how adapters can emit traces (i.e., start and close Spans, emit Events)
extracted from the AgentNode implementation of the LangGraph's adapter in ``pyagentspec==26.1.0``.

.. code-block:: python

   with AgentExecutionSpan(name=f"AgentExecution - {agentspec_agent.name}", agent=agentspec_agent) as span:
       span.add_event(AgentExecutionStart(inputs=inputs))
       result = agent.invoke(inputs, config)
       outputs = result.outputs if hasattr(result, "outputs") else {}
       span.add_event(AgentExecutionEnd(outputs=outputs))

Consuming traces (consumer example)
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   class OpenTelemetrySpanProcessor(SpanProcessor):

       def __init__(self, sdk_processor: OtelSdkSpanProcessor):
           self._sdk_processor = sdk_processor

       def on_start(self, span: "Span") -> None:
           otel_span = self._to_otel_span(span)
           otel_span.start(start_time=span.start_time)
           self._sdk_processor.on_start(span=otel_span)

       def on_end(self, span: "Span") -> None:
           otel_span = self._to_otel_span(span)
           otel_span.end(end_time=span.end_time)
           self._sdk_processor.on_end(span=otel_span)

       def on_event(self, event: Event, span: Span) -> None:
           # Other processors may use this hook to stream events
           pass

       def startup(self) -> None:
           ...

       def shutdown(self) -> None:
           self._sdk_processor.shutdown

Interoperability examples
-------------------------

Tracing with LangGraph

.. code-block:: python

   from pyagentspec.adapters.langgraph import AgentSpecLoader
   from openinference_spanprocessor import ArizePhoenixSpanProcessor
   # Assuming this package implements a SpanProcessor that takes the Agent Spec Traces and sends them to a Phoenix Arize server

   agent_json = read_json_file("my/agentspec/agent.json")
   processor = ArizePhoenixSpanProcessor(mask_sensitive_information=False, project_name="agentspec-tracing-test")

   with Trace(name="agentspec_langgraph_demo", span_processors=[processor]) as trace:
       agent = AgentSpecLoader().load_json(agent_json)
       result = agent.invoke({"inputs": {}, "messages": []})

Tracing with WayFlow

.. code-block:: python

   from wayflowcore.agentspec import AgentSpecLoader
   from wayflowcore.agentspec.tracing import AgentSpecTracingEventListener
   from wayflowcore.events.eventlistener import register_event_listeners
   from openinference_spanprocessor import ArizePhoenixSpanProcessor

   agent_json = read_json_file("my/agentspec/agent.json")
   processor = ArizePhoenixSpanProcessor(mask_sensitive_information=False, project_name="agentspec-tracing-test")

   with register_event_listeners([AgentSpecTracingEventListener()]):
       with Trace(name="agentspec_wayflow_demo", span_processors=[processor]) as trace:
           agent = AgentSpecLoader().load_json(agent_json)
           conversation = agent.start_conversation()
           status = conversation.execute()


Security Considerations
=======================

Agent Spec Tracing inherits all security requirements from Agent Spec (see :doc:`../security`).
Additionally, tracing frequently includes potentially sensitive information (PII), including, but not limited to:

- LLM prompts and generated content
- Tool inputs/outputs
- Exception messages and stacktraces
- Conversation messages

Implementing a SpanProcessor
----------------------------

Key points:

* **Async / non-blocking** - keep the span processor off the critical path to avoid impacting agent's performance.
* **Robust error handling** - never raise from span processor methods; drop or queue on failure.
* **Back-pressure** - apply rate limits, size limits, or batch Spans and Events to avoid DoS on the collector.

Sensitive fields
----------------

Each event table above flags attributes that are considered sensitive.
Producers SHOULD mark and/or emit them using Agent Spec's Sensitive Field mechanism where
applicable; consumers (SpanProcessors) SHOULD:

- Mask or omit sensitive fields by default when exporting traces.
- Provide an explicit configuration to unmask for trusted environments.
- Avoid logging or exporting sensitive data inadvertently.

Guidelines:

- Attribute-level masking: redact entire values or apply strongly irreversible
  masking (e.g., replace content with fixed placeholders or hashes as policy dictates).
- Downstream mappers (e.g., OpenTelemetry exporters) MUST NOT downgrade masking guarantees.
- When masking affects correlation (e.g., truncating request_id), preserve minimal
  non-sensitive identifiers for linkage.

Design Notes and Best Practices
===============================

- Event emission ordering: Within a span, events SHOULD be in timestamp order.
- Time units: Use nanoseconds since epoch for timestamps and start/end times
  for consistency with common tracing systems.
- Nesting: Prefer nesting spans to represent sub-operations (e.g., NodeExecutionSpan
  under FlowExecutionSpan, ToolExecutionSpan under AgentExecutionSpan).
- Exceptions: Emit ExceptionRaised with type/message/stacktrace and consider adding
  it before ending the current span or on a dedicated error span, depending on runtime design.


FAQ and Open Questions
======================

Naming alignment with observability
-----------------------------------

This specification uses tracing terminology common in OpenTelemetry (Trace,
Span, Event, SpanProcessor) to leverage community familiarity.

Environment context
-------------------

This version focuses on agentic execution tracing. Future versions may add
execution-environment spans or include environment metadata on Trace.
