"""ManagerWorkers / Swarm LangGraph compilation helpers.

Module-level building blocks for compiling a ``ManagerWorkers`` (and a
``ManagerWorkers`` acting as a ``Swarm`` member) into LangGraph. The
``AgentSpecToLangGraphConverter`` methods ``_manager_workers_convert_to_langgraph``
and ``_swarm_convert_to_langgraph`` orchestrate these helpers; the helpers
themselves are pure functions with no dependency on the converter, which is
why they live here rather than bloating the converter module.

    its call ids before its reply ToolMessages are tested for removal.
