      * *handoff_conversation* — a tool for transferring the full user–agent conversation to another agent.

    Delegation is limited to message-passing:

      * Agents *can* use *send_message* to request a sub-task from another agent.

    As a consequence, the ``first_agent`` always remains the primary point of contact with the user.

    This gives agents full flexibility:

      * They may pass a message to another agent and wait for a reply.

    This mode enforces a strict chain-of-ownership: whenever an agent involves another agent,
    it must transfer the full dialogue context. The next agent can either respond directly to the user
    or continue handing off the conversation to another agent.

    Defines a ``Swarm`` conversational component.

    A ``Swarm`` is a multi-agent conversational component in which each agent determines
    the next agent to be executed, based on a list of pre-defined relationships.
    Agents in Swarm can be any ``AgenticComponent``.

    ``HandoffMode.ALWAYS``: Agents cannot send messages to other agents. Any delegation must be performed through *handoff_conversation*;

    A key benefit of using Handoff is the reduced response latency: While talking to other agents increases the "distance"
    between the human user and the current agent, transferring a conversation to another agent keeps this distance unchanged
    (i.e. the agent interacting with the user is different but the user is still the same). However, transferring the full conversation might increase the token usage.
